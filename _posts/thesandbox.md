The Sandbox is a community-driven platform where creators can monetize voxel ASSETS and gaming experiences on the blockchain.
History- Creators – Pixowl 

## Virtual worlds in Depth (The SandBoxGame)
Think of it as another virtual world that lives in parallel to our physical world — a world that we can freely access through the internet and compatible hardware devices.

Think, the Ready Player One movie by Spielberg.

And while the Metaverse can be seen as a game, it can also just be another plane of existence — where we can interact with one another.
We at Fillmore XR are focusing on one of the Main virtual worlds has we believe that this platform has great potential.

## TheSandboxGame:
The Sandbox
A public beta of The Sandbox was launched in March 2012 and the team collected data during two months since the release from more than 1,000 players. The game was out and the vision behind it was clear: to provide users with a gaming platform that allowed them to create great pixel art.
The Sandbox has proven to be an undebatable success, with a total gross revenue over $5M since 2012 and 5,000 new players every day. The numbers were good.
The Sandbox Evolution was launched in June 2016. This new version empowered players to craft worlds or destroy universes and also let them create their very own games. Within this 2D sequel of the original game, a series of key improvements were included. To start with, it had enhanced physics and side-scrolling worlds 10 times bigger than its predecessor. A remarkably interesting refinement included in this version was the possibility to buy objects with in-game currency that players could earn by completing tasks or by creating content.

Our community has reached more than 700k followers on Facebook and we have created more than 335k videos regarding our game, as well as a total of 70M creations to date.
## The Sandbox Decentralized Gaming Platform
By middle of 2018, Pixowl’s team announced its acquisition by Animoca Brands and shared publicly its ambitions to build a whole new version of The Sandbox. This time, it is fully in 3D, multiplayer, and multi-platforms.

This version of the game aims to be the new standard in world-building games. It combines player-centric world-building experiences and character-driven narratives.
