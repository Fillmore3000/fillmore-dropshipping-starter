Having worked on Blockchain projects for over 2 years. I find these tools great and essential.

Here's a collection of various blockchain development tools that you may encounter, including blockchain frameworks, libraries, clients, and more. Use these tools to write, verify, test, and debug your blockchain code.

## MetaMask
MetaMask is a browser extension that allows you to browse Ethereum blockchain enabled websites.

## Remix IDE
Remix is a Solidity IDE in which you can write your code and check for errors right from your browser.

## Truffle Framework
The "most popular Ethereum development framework" â€” it's a development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for Ethereum.

## Web3.js
This library is the Ethereum-compatible JavaScript API which implements the Generic JSON RPC spec to interact with a local or remote Ethereum nodes.

## Solidity
Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. It was influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript.

## Ganache CLI
Ganache is part of Truffle's suite of dev tools which uses EthereumJS to simulate client behavior to make developing Ethereum applications faster and easier.

## Infura
Infura provides an API and other developer tools to provide secure access to Ethereum and IFPS.
